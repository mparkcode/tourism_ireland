                    <p>Picturesque, little, beautiful seafood heaven.Started with a platter to share which was out of this world. My company continued with scampi and I chose Hake which were both. Weather you live nearby or visiting Dublin, make sure to pop in, you will not be disappointed. Highly recommended</p>

                    <p>Fantastic meal! Service was extremely good with everything you would expect from a restaurant with such a good reputation. Food was beautifully and perfectly prepared. The beef in particular was perfectly cooked and the dessert was simple amazing. Highly recommend this place.</p>

                    <h3>The Vintage Kitchen</h3>
                    <p>Wonderful restaurant with a very nice atmosphere and friendly service. The room is very tiny, the kitchen included - anyway around 30 people find a spot. Food is presented in a nice way in nice pans and/or on wooden plates.  The drink menu is simple - one white, one red, sparkling wine and that's it. The red wine was fantastic. Water is included. The food was good, my steak was more medium well than medium rare which is the only negative point. However, for the overall experience the vintage kitchen deserves a 5 star rating!
                        Thanks for the nice evening!</p>
